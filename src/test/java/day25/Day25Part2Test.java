/**
 * --- Part Two ---
 * 
 * You and The Historians crowd into the office, startling the Chief Historian awake! The Historians all take turns 
 *   looking confused until one asks where he's been for the last few months.
 * 
 * "I've been right here, working on this high-priority request from Santa! I think the only time I even stepped away 
 *   was about a month ago when I went to grab a cup of coffee..."
 * 
 * Just then, the Chief notices the time. "Oh no! I'm going to be late! I must have fallen asleep trying to put 
 *   the finishing touches on this chronicle Santa requested, but now I don't have enough time to go visit the last 50 
 *   places on my list and complete the chronicle before Santa leaves! He said he needed it before tonight's sleigh launch."
 * 
 * One of The Historians holds up the list they've been using this whole time to keep track of where they've been searching. 
 *   Next to each place you all visited, they checked off that place with a star. Other Historians hold up their own notes 
 *   they took on the journey; as The Historians, how could they resist writing everything down while visiting all those 
 *   historically significant places?
 * 
 * The Chief's eyes get wide. "With all this, we might just have enough time to finish the chronicle! Santa said 
 *   he wanted it wrapped up with a bow, so I'll call down to the wrapping department and... hey, could you bring it up 
 *   to Santa? I'll need to be in my seat to watch the sleigh launch by then."
 * 
 * You nod, and The Historians quickly work to collect their notes into the final set of pages for the chronicle.
 * 
 * You don't have enough stars to finish the chronicle, though. You need 7 more.
